android-sdk-installer (1.0.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Add 64-bit package
  * Conditional dependencies based on distribution
  * Support updates
  * Delete downloaded zipfiles
  * Only support certain versions
    - The installer includes the list of urls that should be downloaded.
      It is also checked in and accessible via bitly links (see README.md).
      This is a way to make sure that a minimum version of the tools is
      available for the app-builders.  If the files are downloaded, then
      they have to match the expectations of the installer.
